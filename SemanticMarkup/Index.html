<h4>Sometimes people say important things</h4>
<!-- description of next section -->
<p>You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.</p>

<h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h2>
<!-- description -->
<div>At least, not anymore...</div>

<!-- title for next item -->
<h3>Want bold text?</h3>
<!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
<p>There's a wrong way and a <b>right way</b>. Always use the right way!</p>

<!-- title for next item -->
<h3>Maybe you need some italics?</h3>
<!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
Again, it used to be done like this. This is wrong. This is the right way.

<h3>Separation of concerns</h3>
<!-- description -->
<p>The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. 
    It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!</p>

Links
<!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from place to place on the internet.

Sections
<!-- go back through and group each section correctly
     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this
